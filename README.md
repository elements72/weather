# Albert-Weather
This extension adds in albert the possibility of searching weather condition for the city indicated.

Actually is pretty simple and shows only the temperature and the weather for the **current day**.

It uses geopy library for searching the **latitude and logitude** of the query,
this coordinates are used to make a request to http://www.7timer.info/ API (token free service for the weather) and to obtain the needed informations.
